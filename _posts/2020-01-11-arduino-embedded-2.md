## Data analysis
Today I'm working with the data that I gathered from "habitaclia.com", related to the flat renting market in Madrid. Find this data here(https://github.com/artikblue/datasets-analyses)  
In this post I will walk you a little bit through the data I gathered:
### Basic data analysis
As the dataset is stored in a mongo db the first step is connecting to it and retrieving the collection.
~~~
> con <- mongo("realestate_renting", url = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/habitaclia")
> con$count()
[1] 6114
~~~
We can see that our dataset is composed by a total of 6114 flat renting offers.  
With the dataset loaded we can start by doing some basic descriptive statistics. As it is important to know about what data we are doing our analysis we can print the urban areas and the villages were the offers we just retrieved belong.

As we are doing our analysis on the real estate renting market one obviously interesting thing to know is the avg renting price and the avg surface. As we are dealing with a lot of offers and some of them (specially the luxuriy properties) can have a very high price, using the median here is interesting and more revealing.
~~~
> print("general means")
[1] "general means"
> # GENERAL MEANS (relevant data)
> sapply(mydata["price"],mean)
   price 
2117.328
> sapply(mydata["price"],median)
price 
 1300 
> sapply(mydata["surface"],mean)
 surface 
128.5034 
~~~
And done that, we can notice an interesting difference between the median and the mean.  
Box plots are also quite interesting and somehow confirm the theory I just presented. The boxplot related to the price shows that almost all values are between a specific range and then some outliers appear in the upper sector, so those are luxury properties for sure.
![priceboxplot](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/priceboxplot.png)
Regarding to the surface something similar happens but not as extreme, probably because expensive properties are more about luxury than just "space".
![surfaceboxplot](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/boxplotsurface)
Those two other boxplots I think are quite less relevant and follow the same logic.

![roomsboxplot](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/boxplotrooms.png)

![toiletsboxplot](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/boxplottoilets.png)

We can also generate the density graphs for each feat to quickly identify if they follow a normal distribution along all of the elements.  
In the first graph, related to the price we can see that almost all of the values are concentrated at the very beggining and so the outliers have a big effect on "breaking" the normality.  


![pricedensity](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/densityprice.png)

Regarding to the surface all of the values are located between about 30 and 200 which is somehow expected, then we may have some very big properties but not to many.


![surfacedensity](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/surfacedensity.png)
The rooms and toilets follow the same logic, we see that the graphic is fluctuating because we have few "integer" values of each like 1,2,3... and all of the elements match at least in one category.

![toiletsdensity](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/toiletsdensity.png)

As a conclusion of this first stage of the analysis a summary of the data can complete this big picture for us:
~~~
> print("data summaries")
[1] "data summaries"
> # SUMMARIES
> summary(mydata$price)
     Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. 
    200.0     936.2    1300.0    2117.3    2000.0 1800000.0 
> summary(mydata$surface)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    0.0    65.0    92.0   128.5   142.8   992.0 
> summary(mydata$numpics)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   0.00   11.00   18.00   20.32   28.00  123.00 
> summary(mydata$rooms)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   1.00    2.00    2.00    2.61    3.00   24.00 
> summary(mydata$toilets)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  1.000   1.000   2.000   1.997   2.000  26.000 
~~~
From the data summary we can basically extract that prices range from 200EUR to 1800000EUR the avg house/flat may have a cost I would say between 1300EUR and 2000EUR and it would have a surface between 92m2 and 100m2 and would have 1 toilet and 2 or 3 rooms. Most of the offer posts include 18 pics. There is nothing much more to extract.  
We can also try to identify some correlation between features by generating the pairs graph.
![basicpairs](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/basicpairs.png)
One can guess that price and surface may have correlation but price may depend on other factors such as location or luxury. In other terms price and surface have correlation but at the very beggining of the scale, then other factors come to play .Of course surface and rooms and toilets have correlation.
### Analysis by categories
As the offers belong to specif categories such as zone or or village, we can try groping our data by those and exploring the differences between each.
~~~
> villages <- mydata %>%
+   group_by(village) %>%
+   summarize(price_mean=mean(price), price_deviation=sd(price), price_var=var(price),
+             price_median=median(price), total_val=length(price),price_max=max(price),
+             price_min=min(price),price_range=max(price)-min(price), rooms_med=mean(rooms), 
+             toilets_med=mean(toilets), npics_med=mean(numpics),
+             surface_max=max(surface), surface_min=min(surface), surface_mean=mean(surface),
+             surface_median=median(surface), surface_sd=sd(surface), surface_varr=var(surface),
+             surface_range=max(surface)-min(surface), price_meter=sum(price)/sum(surface))
> zones <- mydata %>%
+   group_by(subzone) %>%
+   summarize(price_mean=mean(price), price_deviation=sd(price), price_var=var(price),
+             price_median=median(price), total_val=length(price),price_max=max(price),
+             price_min=min(price),price_range=max(price)-min(price), rooms_med=mean(rooms), 
+             toilets_med=mean(toilets), npics_med=mean(numpics),
+             surface_max=max(surface), surface_min=min(surface), surface_mean=mean(surface),
+             surface_median=median(surface), surface_sd=sd(surface), surface_varr=var(surface),
+             surface_range=max(surface)-min(surface), price_meter=sum(price)/sum(surface))

Then we can analyze the zones who have more offers, the more expensive zones and the zones who offer larger spaces:

Not a big surpise that most of the offers are located in the metropolital area (aka the big city). Another interesting fact here is that living in small villages outside the metropilitan area can be very cheap.  
If we go by village (or quarter in the big city) we see that most of the offers are located in the very city centre.

We can also note that the most expensive properties are located in the peripheria of the big city in luxury districts.  
The other interesting category here is the one related to companies:

We can see that SERVICHECK and EMMANUEL are the top offering companies and we can also identify potential luxury companies such as MIRANDA, LINDEA DE GESTIÓN and REDPISO LAS TABLAS.  
Seen that, we can end our general analysis by looking at the most common values on each category:
~~~

As we saw before, most of the prices range from 900 to 1300 and surfaces go from 60 to 100.
### Cluster analysis
As we saw in the first stage of this analysis, it is clear that we have different "categories" of properties (ex: rural vs urban, luxury vs affordable etc). In these situations running a cluster analysis can be helpful.
~~~
> ds <- select(mydata, 4,5,6,7,9) # all of the numeric feats
> # KMEANS
> dcluster <- kmeans(ds, 6, nstart = 1)
> dcluster
K-means clustering with 6 clusters of sizes 1301, 19, 293, 1, 4499, 1

Cluster means:
        price   surface    rooms  toilets  numpics
1    2742.738 195.87087 3.450423 2.860876 26.18370
2   16500.000 289.31579 7.684211 7.894737 36.73684
3    5831.676 402.96928 5.051195 4.935154 32.50853
4 1800000.000 350.00000 5.000000 4.000000 14.00000
5    1134.665  90.35074 2.185819 1.530118 17.76039
6  450000.000 437.00000 4.000000 3.000000 58.00000
~~~
In this case a cluster analysis is a bit revealing as it shows multiple categories. From those categories one of them (number 5) clearly corresponds to the category we just defined in the previous stage. Other categories correspond to (probably) other significant market sectors such as categories 1 and 3. The rest of the categories correspond to highly expensive properties I can't even dream of.  
  
So having those identified, we can extract them from the general dataset.
~~~
> group1 <- filter(mydata, price >250 & price < 1600)
> mean(data.matrix(group1["price"]))
[1] 1044.116
> sd(data.matrix(group1["price"]))
[1] 268.9029
~~~
And repeat our analyses focused on each group:

~~~
> shapiro.test(data.matrix(group1["price"]))

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  data.matrix(group1["price"])
W = 0.97499, p-value < 2.2e-16
~~~
So we can see that we don't have a normal distribution in terms of the price eventhough there is more "normality" here than in the general group.

![basicpairs](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/group1pairs.png)
It is very interesting to note here that as we move to this general group (let's say the avg property for the avg family) we can appreciate how in here price and surface do really correlate somehow.


![basicpairs](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/group1regression.png)

~~~
> regresion = lm(data.matrix(group1["price"]) ~ data.matrix(group1["surface"])) 
> plot(price ~ surface, group1)
> abline (regresion, lwd=1, col ="red" )

Call:
lm(formula = data.matrix(group1["price"]) ~ data.matrix(group1["surface"]))

Coefficients:
                   (Intercept)  data.matrix(group1["surface"])  
                       891.924                           1.807  

> cor.test(data.matrix(group1["surface"]), data.matrix(group1["price"]), method=c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))

	Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  data.matrix(group1["surface"]) and data.matrix(group1["price"])
t = 20.224, df = 3902, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.2793456 0.3361389
sample estimates:
      cor 
0.3080166 
~~~
Anyway correlation is still weak here.  
  
Let's go for the second group, expensive properties.

~~~
> group2 <- filter(mydata, price > 1600 & price < 3200)
> mean(data.matrix(group2["price"]))
[1] 2234.894
> sd(data.matrix(group2["price"]))
[1] 419.5886
~~~
![basicpairs](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/group2density.png)
We have a small degree of normality here but most of the properties range from 1500 to 2000.
~~~
> shapiro.test(data.matrix(group2["price"]))

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  data.matrix(group2["price"])
W = 0.93823, p-value < 2.2e-16
~~~
Anyway, we can see that we don't have a normal distribution here either.

We still have a bit more regression here than in the general group, but its more weird than the previous group.  

And at the end we can categorize our elements and see how each group represents a % of the total.
~~~
> mydata$price_category<-ifelse(mydata$price <500, "VERYCHEAP", ifelse(mydata$price <1000,"NORMAL", ifelse(mydata$price < 5000,"EXPENSIVE","HIGHEXPENSIVE")))
> nrow(subset(mydata,price_category == "VERYCHEAP")) / nrow(mydata)
[1] 0.007360157
> nrow(subset(mydata,price_category == "NORMAL")) / nrow(mydata)
[1] 0.2924436
> nrow(subset(mydata,price_category == "EXPENSIVE")) / nrow(mydata)
[1] 0.6640497
> nrow(subset(mydata,price_category == "HIGHEXPENSIVE")) / nrow(mydata)
[1] 0.03614655
~~~
And we see how most of the properties belong to the "EXPENSIVE" category.  
### Predictive analysis
Can we predict the price of a property based on its features? Well, let's be honest, probably NOT. But we can try that anyway.
  
Neuralnet package offers a nice way to do that. We can select all of the numerical feats of our dataset, split the dataset into 60-40 for training and validation and run some tests.
~~~
library(neuralnet)
ds <- select(mydata, 4,5,6,7,9) 
dvals <- ds
samplesize <-0.60 * nrow(dvals)
set.seed(80)
index = sample(seq_len(nrow(ds)),size = samplesize)

datatrain = dvals[ index, ]
datatest = dvals[ -index, ]

max = apply(dvals , 2 , max)
min = apply(dvals, 2 , min)
scaled = as.data.frame(scale(dvals, center = min, scale = max - min))

trainNN = scaled[index , ]
testNN = scaled[-index , ]

# fit neural network price
set.seed(2)
NN = neuralnet(price ~ toilets + surface + rooms , trainNN, hidden = c(4,3,4) , linear.output = T )

# plot neural network
plot(NN)
~~~
We can even plot the neuralnetwork. And as we see the error is so high.  
![basicpairs](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/neuralnet.png)
  And we can plot the regression as well:
~~~
predict_testNN = compute(NN, testNN[,c(1:4)])
predict_testNN = (predict_testNN$net.result * (max(dvals$price) - min(dvals$price))) + min(dvals$price)

plot(datatest$price, predict_testNN, col='blue', pch=16, ylab = "predicted price NN", xlab = "real price")

abline(0,1)
~~~
It looks like we have a straight regression but... note that due to that outlier the scale moves a lot... so....
![basicpairs](https://artikblue.github.io/assets/images/madrid_renting/neuralregression.png)  
  We can calculate the RMSE:
~~~
> # Calculate Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
> RMSE.NN = (sum((datatest$price - predict_testNN)^2) / nrow(datatest)) ^ 0.5
> RMSE.NN
[1] 9128.876
~~~
And it shows that the error is really high...!  
I will update this post soon with more interesting conclusions :)
