#### About this course
This series of post that I'm starting with this one will cover the fundamentals of reverse engineering with the "popular" radare2 framework. What I want to do here is to walk you through a diverse set of examples of C-written binaries that will cover the most common algorithms and data structures you can find in programs out there, so at the end you will be able to identify them and work with them. This won't be an advanced/pro course but it will start from the very bottom and will cover far more than the average free course/tutorial. 
  
On these series of posts we'll start with an C source file / algorithm, compile it in both 32 bits and 64 bits systems and then reverse engineer it using radare2, so you'll be able to appreciate the differences between 32 and 64 bit binaries. Once we cover the fundamentals of reversing we'll focus on x64.
  
I assume that you have some fundamental knowledge about computer arquitectures and know some basic asm instructions such as mov, push and such. I also assume that you already know what radare2 is and thus want to *finally* learn how to use it.

#### Getting radare2

Most of the people who use radare2 use it on Linux systems, as from there you can analyze all sorts of binaries and if you want to debug them you can connect to a remote debug session or use gbd on Linux. In here we'll use r2 on Linux most of the time and move it to Windows when needed.

Radare2 supports a ton of arquitectures from from x64 to arduinos or tamagochis and you can analyze binaries related to those arquitectures from the comfort of your ubuntu system or whatever you use. 
  
Said that, the best way to get radare2, as the webpage itself suggests is to clone it from the repositories:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2
cd radare2
sys/install.sh   # just run this script to update r2 from git
~~~
You can also install it from the apt/rpm/yaourt/whatever repo in most distributions with something like:

~~~
sudo apt-get install radare2
~~~

And if you wish to use it on windows you can [download the windows setup](https://rada.re/r/down.html) from its website.

#### Hello world
Every programming journy begins with the classical hello world program and this one won't be less. And a hello world in C language will look exactly like that:
```

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

A program like that can be easily compiled using the GCC compiler like this:

~~~
gcc -w hello_world.c -o hello_word
~~~
And if we run it we are basically going to get a "Hello, World!" on our screen and that will be all, very simple but we need to begin with something :)
  
Once the program is compiled we can open it with r2 by using "radare2 program" where program is the program you want to analyze, r2 is also an alias of radare2 so you can use it instead if you want. Once the binary is loaded, we need radare to parse the program; running aaaa will analize the binary and detect data structures, functions calls and these kinds of elements. If you want to better understand how this works [this answer on stackoverflow](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/19895/radares-aaaa-and-aa-what-does-it-do-exactly) is quite explainatory.

Once the program is loaded and parsed, plenty of actions can be done on it, such as listing strings, disassembling code blocks and more. One of the most common things you'll want to do when you get your hands on an unknown binary is to get a list of its functions. You can do it using the afl command.
~~~
[0x08048310]> afl
0x08048310    1 33           entry0
0x080482f0    1 6            sym.imp.__libc_start_main

0x080482e0    1 6            sym.imp.printf
0x080482ac    3 35           sym._init

In examples such as this one, the most interesting function is "main". Entry* functions can be interesting as well but as this is a hello world program in functions like those you'll probably find a bunch of code you won't understand at all at this moment (some internal stuff added by the compiler) so we can leave them for now. Other functions we are seeing in this example are related to the C libraries/calls used by the progam (as the printf call you'll probably identify there).
  
Another interesting initial thing we can do here is for example get the general information about the binary with *iI*:
~~~

[0x08048310]>

That will prompt values such as the architecture or the compiler. Those values are always interesting so we can know what we are dealing with and start discarting strategies focusing on what matters.
  
We can also list the imports with *ii*
~~~
[0x08048310]> ii
[Imports]
nth                vaddr              bind   type              name

577730619514028035 0xb6f9994600000000 FUNC   __libc_start_main 
~~~
In this particular case, by know we should be sure that we are dealing with a simple program written in C.
  
Another command of our interest may be the *iz* one. That will list all of the strings contained within the data section of the program (*izz* will list strings in the whole file). That command is specially useful when dealing with simple crackmes (so we can identify hardcoded passwords).  

In general terms knowing the strings inside a program is helpful when it comes to getting a general idea of "what the program is about".
~~~

[0x08048310]> 
~~~
As we can see, iz detects the "Hello, World!" string, the string that appears everytime we run the program. Radare also tells us about the section (ascii) and the location of the string.  
  
Now that we know some of the very basic fundamentals let's actually reverse the program and try to figure out what and how it does.

The first thing that we have to understand here is that, we are inspecting main, and main is a function, so it has to return to somewhere and it may receive arguments or need space for local variables, operations related to those aspects are performed at the beggining and the end of the code.
  

The part that we'll have to focus on here starts with push str.Hello__World and then the call to printf. In 32 bits systems the way of passing parameters to functions consists of pushing those parameters to the stack and then executing a call operation on the address of the function. So something like "printf(a);" in C would be a "push a; call printf" in asm. [So what about the rest of the code?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36046201/why-do-we-push-ebp-and-mov-ebp-esp-in-the-callee-in-assembly) Well, the first part of the code is related establishing a new [stack frame](http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch10s07.html) and a stack frame is nothing more than a section of the code that will contain local variables of the function, arguments passed and values such as that. The end of the code


#### x64 binaries and its particularities
Let's repeat the process now but compiling the same program and opening it in r2 in an x64 system.

The main difference between a x32 program and a x64 one in small examples like this one is that, as you may have seen parameters to functions aren't passed by the stack. In x64 programs like this one, parameters are passed using registers such as rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8 and r9 in that order. We'll keep walking through the x64 architecture with clear and specific examples but [you may want to consider reading a cheatsheet like this one to gain a more solider understanding on topics such as this last one](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/docs/guides/x64_cheatsheet.pdf)
  
There is nothing much more to comment by now.

If we look at the code, in this case, at the beggining of the code, we can appreciate a "push rbp, mov ebp, rsp" This is related to the stack alignment. Then what comes next is way more clear, with lea we load the effective address of the null terminated string "Hello, World!" to the RDI register, then we load the hex value 0 to eax and we proceed to call printf(). We load eax with 0 mainly because the printf function has variable arguments such as the string and a whole lot of format related parameters among others, printf can work with vector registers, for example when doing printf("%f", 1.0f) then the progam will have to set eax to 1 to indicate that. [This stackoverflow question offers a very clear explanation on the mov eax,0 issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6212665/why-is-eax-zeroed-before-a-call-to-printf)
  
At the end of the program, we see a mov eax, 0 then pop rbp and a ret being executed. The first the the first one seats eax to 0 as it gets the program ready to do a "return 0" then the second one restores the stack to its original state via picking the original stack frame value to rbp. Then ret just returns the function exiting it with 0 value.

| iI              | Information about the binary         |
| iz              | List strings in the binary           |
| sf   function   | Seek to a function                   |
