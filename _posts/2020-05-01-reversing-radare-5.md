Hi folks and welcome back to the most awesome reverse engineering with r2 post series 8) Today I'm going to drop some notes on very basic variable types you may encounter when reversing C code (and in general terms) and we'll review how casting is done at low level. It will be relatively quick.

![20min adventure](assets/images/20min.jpg)

Casting is a way we have to "convert" a variable of one kind to another kind. By the way, tutorialspoint makes it very easy to understand:

"Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows âˆ’ (type_name) expression"

Let's review a simple example:
```C
# include <stdio.h>

main(){

 func();    
 getchar();
}

func(){

int val = 2;
float a = 5.25;

int b = (int)a;

printf ("%d\n", b);  

}
```

The disasm looks like this:

At first sight, we can see some new instructions such as movss and the weird cvttss2si we never saw on the previous posts. Also new registers are being used: xmm0. In brief xmm registers that usually go from xmm0 to xmm7 are used to store floating point numbers, they have a size of 128 bits, as a float needs more space than an int. 

In a situation such as this, we generally have 2 options we can either try to interpret those instructions one by one and figure out what the program does or we can just set a breakpoint, for example, after xmm0 is stored to local_8h and inspect the content:

As we can see, at first local_ch is initialized with 2, thats an easy one it should be a simple int variable, then the content of 0x563463519778 is loaded into xmm0 register and that goes to the variable local_8h. If we inspect the contents of the xmm0 register by using drt, we'll see 0x40a80000, that corresponds to 5.25 in float. 

```
rax2 Fx40a80000
5.250000f
```
Radare2 can help us with that as it can auto detect variable types, at this point of the program if we do afta, we'll see how those change:
```

[...]
[0x558e5889c6a4]> 
```
And with afvt var type we can set the type of the variable ourselves. Regarding to the instructions used here:
```
|           0x5634635196b3      f30f1005bd00.  movss xmm0, dword [0x563463519778] ; [0x563463519778:4]=0x40a80000
|           0x5634635196bb      f30f1145f8     movss dword [local_8h], xmm0
|           0x5634635196c0      f30f1045f8     movss xmm0, dword [local_8h]
|           ;-- rip:
|           0x5634635196c5 b    f30f2cc0       cvttss2si eax, xmm0
```
Movss (move scalar single precision floating point value) moves a scalar single-precision floating-point value from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). The source and destination operands can be XMM registers or 32-bit memory locations. So that is basically used as the common mov but for floating point vals as those are bigger. Then cvttss2si (convert with truncation scalar single precision floating point value to integer) is what basically does the casting here, it truncates cuts the decimal part from the float and extracts and int, going from 5.25 to 5. The rest of the disasm should already be familiar to the reader :)

Let's now do another kind of casting, this time we'll go from character to integer.


```C
# include <stdio.h>

main(){

 func();    
 getchar();
}

func(){

char b = 'a';

int x = (int)b;
printf ("%d", x);
}
```
And if we look at the disasm...

This one is mega simple, the thing happens here:
```
|           0x55b8bc8c96ac      c645fb61       mov byte [local_5h], 0x61 ; 'a' ; 97
|           0x55b8bc8c96b0      0fbe45fb       movsx eax, byte [local_5h]
|           0x55b8bc8c96b4      8945fc         mov dword [local_4h], eax
|           0x55b8bc8c96b7      8b45fc         mov eax, dword [local_4h]
```
byte 0x61 (ascii a) is stored in local_5h, good that should mean char b = 'a', then it goes to EAX (we don't use rax, as the var is a single byte) and from there it goes to local_4h and that should mean int x = (int) b; then params are passed and printf is called, easy. movsx is used here as it moves with sign extension is it a common technique to use it when it comes to casting from int to char and from char to int (more info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7762214/assembly-converting-mov-movzx-and-movsx-to-c-code-no-inline-asm)

Let's finish this one with a last example


```C
# include <stdio.h>

main(){

 func();    
 getchar();
}

func(){
char b = 'a';

int x = (int)b;
printf ("%d\n", x);
printf ("%d\n", b);

}
```
As you can see, we start with the chracter 'a' we store it as both char and int using two variables and then we print both. The key thing to note here is that both of the times we pass the format string %d to printf, as %d is for printing the int value, we'll get 97 as the output both of the times! So 0x61 represents both 97 dec and ascii 'a' it is the same, the only diference here is that if we pretend to store an int we'll need two times the space of a char, that's all. The output format will depend on the format string in printf.

Let's see
