Hi there, I hope you are all good, as I promised here we have this next part of the reversing with radare2 mini course :)

Today we are still going to review some basic data structures you will encounter on many projects. According to my experience the key concepts on reverse engineering are identifying data structures, knowing basic operations and then it's all about the specific problem you want to solve, if you are on malware analysis then you'll have to focus on common malware tricks such as the use of specific syscalls or packing/encrypting techniques etc, if you are on exploit dev you'll focus more on specific protocols you want to analyse and fuzz, I've also known some people who do privacy analysis on apps and focus more on anything related to network protocols. You know, any specific area has its particularities and you'll but before going deep into any of those you'll need a solid base on common aspects such as data structures as everything is build on top of them.

On my last post we walked through some basic arrays (int and char) today we are going to go through more complex examples.

#### Multi dimensional arrays

Even the name sounds pretty cool those are very simple data structures also. An array can contain any element of whatever type inside, we can have arrays of ints, arrays of floats, of chars ...and we can have arrays of arrays. By the way, we can have arrays of arrays of arrays of [...].

Let's inspect the following code:

```c
# include <stdio.h>

main(){

 func();    
 getchar();
}

func(){
  int marks[2][10] = 
     { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
       11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 };

 
  printf("Mark related to third student on first group %d",
    marks[0][2]);
  printf("Mark related to third student on second group %d",
    marks[1][2]);

}
```
As you can see, we declare an int array of 2 dimensions and we initialize it with some values. Whats interesting here is that we initialize the two arrays one right after the other! It may look like we only have one big array of 20 vals instead of two arrays of 10 vals one "on top(?)" of the other. If you think about it, it makes all the sense, is there any other way to do it? At the end, the program will have to store those values (two arrays) in memory and they are part of the same "structure"  so it makes all the sense to allocate them together one after the other by the way doing it differently  won't make much sense. 



Let's see how it works internally:

The values are set and then, the needed variables are passed to printf, that's all. You may encounter scenarios like this one sometimes. When we see something like this, we may want to get rid of some useles local_whatever tags, we know that we can delete any disturbin var with avf- and make them look nicer with avfn

When dealing with an array, in general terms we just need to note its base address, as if we know the base addr and the size we can get to anything, so label correctly that address and take your notes. But how to inspect those arrays in a more efficient way? The "pf" command in radare2 can help us when it comes to inspecting memory:

That was nice! We were able to retrieve 20 signed decimal integers starting from 0x7ffdd66dcf60. After pf we use 20d to indicate that we want to retrieve 20 values using the format string %d starting from that address, we can use other format strings such as %c for chars %f for float or %s, %x for hex or for string. We can even chain format strings doing something like 20iiis to specify that we want to represent three integers and a string, we'll review that more deeply further in this "course".

So briefly, on this perspective having an array of arrays is, on a practical level, almost the same as having a single large array as everything will be together, it is more like a semantic trick for making it easier for us, the h u m a n s, to work with data structures while programming.

#### Structs 

But most of the time, specially if we are deing with projects that are somehow more "serious", we can expect to encounter more advanced data structures that may be asociated with objects. At the end, those structures will be comprised sets of arrays, tags of memory addresses and simple variables. That is one of the reasons why I love to work at the low level, everything becomes super simple.

In languages such as C, we can define more complex custom data structures by using struct. Sometimes we may want to have a unique reference for a set of data that is related to a particular topic on your program, for example you may want to store the coordinates of a single geo point, or perhaps store the data of a subject with its name and the final marks of the students or whatever you need to do, you get the concept. Struct is used in C for that, as you can see on the following code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct students {
   int a[20];
   char  b[20];
};
 
int main( ) {
        time_t t;
        int i, n;
        srand((unsigned) time(&t));
        struct students s1;

        for( i = 0 ; i < 20 ; i++ ) {
              s1.a[i] = rand() % 11;
        }

        for( i = 0 ; i < 20 ; i++ ) {
              printf("%d ",s1.a[i]);
        }

        return 0;
}
```
As you can see the students structure is defined comprised of an int array and a char array as well, then it is initialized further in the code, also note that this time we use another library, stdlib and rand comes into play. 

Let's check that out:

At first sight, by examining those imports we already know that this program deals with random numbers. This time the block of code we want to analyse is at the main function:

The block here may seem bigger that the previous ones but don't let that scare you. On first sight we can detect a couple of loops, the first one probably initializes the array and the second one for sure prints its values one after another as we can see printf being called.

By the way we can even mark that on the disasm, so we can better inspect the whole thing. With CCu comment @ addr we can add a comment to be shown next to a particular mem address.

Let's now get to the first loop:
```
[0x55d00da9477a]> pdf
            ;-- main:
/ (fcn) main 189
|   main ();
|           ; var int local_7ch @ rbp-0x7c
|           ; var int local_78h @ rbp-0x78
|           ; var int local_8h @ rbp-0x8
|              ; DATA XREF from 0x55d00da9468d (entry0)
```
This time the program sets three variables, the stack guard and a couple of vars, local_7ch used for storing i (the loop counter) and then we have local_78h that seems to be related to the tim call.

Let's look closer on that:
```
|           0x55d00da94791      488d4588       lea rax, qword [local_78h]
|           0x55d00da94795      4889c7         mov rdi, rax
|           0x55d00da94798      b800000000     mov eax, 0
|           0x55d00da9479d      e89efeffff     call sym.imp.time       ; time_t time(time_t *timer)
|           0x55d00da947a2      89c7           mov edi, eax
|           0x55d00da947a4      e887feffff     call sym.imp.srand      ; void srand(int seed)
|           0x55d00da947a9      c74584000000.  mov dword [local_7ch], 0
```
As you can see, the memory address of local_78h is passed to time() as a parameter. Then the result of the call (stored in eax) is again pased to srand as the seed, after that the first loop counter is initialized (i=0). The time function works like this: time_t time( time_t *second ) the time function accepts single parameter: second. This parameter is used to set the time_t object which store the time (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/time_t/) And returns current calender time as a object of type time_t. The srand function stands for seed rand (?) I guess and it is used for setting the seed of the random number generrator to be used by the rand() function. The random number generator used by rand() needs a seed as you can imagine it computes a random number by using a mathematical formula (and thus it needs an input). It is important to mark that, using the same seed will procude the same later on on the code. 

Related to the code, as you can see, the output of time function is passed to srand, time is used as the random seed a lot of times cause is one of the most random values we can have inside our machine, other stuff like the mouse position or a random set of words is used as well, more complex systems such as the ones used in banking can even make use of temperature/preassure sensors and so on.

So now that srand has been set, the program will be able to generate nice random numbers by calling the rand function.

With our rand function ready, we'll dive into the first loop:

|      :|   0x55d00da947d2      01c0           add eax, eax
|      :|   0x55d00da947d4      01d0           add eax, edx

|      :|   0x55d00da947df      89548590       mov dword [rbp + rax*4 - 0x70], edx
|      :|   0x55d00da947e3      83458401       add dword [local_7ch], 1
```
For analysing this block, the most fundamental part is to have the following: s1.a[i] = rand() % 11; very present. We can break it in three parts (as you should already know), first we generate the random number, then we do the % 11, then we store the result inside s1.a[i].

So the first part is very clear:
```
|      .--> 0x55d00da947b2      e899feffff     call sym.imp.rand       ; int rand(void)
|      :|   0x55d00da947b7      89c1           mov ecx, eax
```
With rand we obtain a random number (eax) then we store it in ecx as we will operate with it.
The next part should be the % 10, let's see;
```

When dealing with "complex" situations "we don't understand" like this one, we have at least a couple of options. The first option is to get a general grasp on whats going on, on the block of code and proceed looking at the big picture, we can try to set a couple of breakpoints before and after we get into the code block, see how a value gets in and look at the output.

On the other hand, we can inspect the function step by step, tracing the input, setting breakpoints wherever a value is changed. Be careful if you chose this one, cause some functions (ex: win api calls, syscalls, big projects, whatever) can be huge and you'll probably lose a lot of time.

```
The final result is 0x5 -> dec 5, so the random number that has been generated % 10 is 5. Note that the rand() function returns a number that goes from 0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (18446744073709551615) on a x64 machine, then the modulus is used for "cutting" that and setting a max of 50. As you can see on this case rand returned: 0x591fb69a (1495250586) then some operations such as shift aligns and multiplications happen to cut that to what is relative to 10.

If you wish to go deeper on that topic I suggest you reading the discusion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8021772/assembly-language-how-to-do-modulo 

Also note that the mod operation can be done in many ways! There are ways that would look very much clearer than the one used here but the compiler won't think about how nice the thing will look, the compiler will try to maximize the performance and sometimes using a particular set of instrructions can result in a quicker execution on that context.

So, then after that, we see the value being stored in the array the same way we seen before:

```
|      :|   0x555600e8b7da      8b4584         mov eax, dword [local_7ch]
|      :|   0x555600e8b7dd      4898           cdqe
|      :|   0x555600e8b7df      89548590       mov dword [rbp + rax*4 - 0x70], edx
|      :|   0x555600e8b7e3      83458401       add dword [local_7ch], 1
|      :|      ; JMP XREF from 0x555600e8b7b0 (main)
|      :`-> 0x555600e8b7e7      837d8413       cmp dword [local_7ch], 0x13 ; [0x13:4]=-1 ; 19
|      `==< 0x555600e8b7eb      7ec5           jle 0x555600e8b7b2
```


And the loop goes on 20 times. At this point, when dealing with complex data structures that hold or may hold relevant information, it turns out very useful to keep them on track. We may have a general idea on how are they structured or we may have some extra info like a .h file or something. In radare2 it is posible to "map" a definition for the structure to a particular memory address using td and tl. 

As we already know about the code, let's set that struct in radare2 and map it:
```
"td struct students {int a[20]; char  b[20];}"
tl students = 0x7FFD69D8C94C
```
So we can map that struct to the address we see by inspecting the address that we think it may correspond to the starting value of, for example, the array that is being initialized, and then hit dc and see how the program updates (sets) those array values:
```
[0x555600e8b7be]> dc
hit breakpoint at: 555600e8b7be
[0x555600e8b7be]> tl
(students)
 a : 0x7ffd69d8c94c = [ 0, 5, 8, 5, 3, 1, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 9, 2, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6, 6, 0 ]
 b : 0x7ffd69d8c99c = 

```
Having that said, it is important to remark that we can actually we wrong in many ways (like in life), we can miss the base addr and figure out the wrong struct, we gotta use the struct that best fits to our analysis.

Let us now finish this one with a last example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
struct Books {
   char  title[50];
   char  author[50];
   char  subject[100];
   int   book_id;
};
 
int main( ) {

   struct Books Book1;        /* Declare Book1 of type Book */
   struct Books Book2;        /* Declare Book2 of type Book */
 
   /* book 1 specification */
   strcpy( Book1.title, "C Programming");
   strcpy( Book1.author, "Nuha Ali"); 
   strcpy( Book1.subject, "C Programming Tutorial");
   Book1.book_id = 6495407;

   /* book 2 specification */
   strcpy( Book2.title, "Telecom Billing");
   strcpy( Book2.author, "Zara Ali");
   strcpy( Book2.subject, "Telecom Billing Tutorial");
   Book2.book_id = 6495700;
 
   /* print Book1 info */
   printf( "Book 1 title : %s\n", Book1.title);
   printf( "Book 1 author : %s\n", Book1.author);
   printf( "Book 1 subject : %s\n", Book1.subject);
   printf( "Book 1 book_id : %d\n", Book1.book_id);

   /* print Book2 info */
   printf( "Book 2 title : %s\n", Book2.title);
   printf( "Book 2 author : %s\n", Book2.author);
   printf( "Book 2 subject : %s\n", Book2.subject);
   printf( "Book 2 book_id : %d\n", Book2.book_id);

   return 0;
}
```
And the disasm looks like:

```

Again, don't let that code scare you, as it is so rrepetitive. We can split the code in two main sections, first the code initializes some data and then it prints it out. On that first section, we can also identify some kind of pattern, two blocks, both ending with one assignment:

```
|           0x56315b93e72e      66c74014616c   mov word [rax + 0x14], 0x6c61 ; [0x6c61:2]=0xffff
|           0x56315b93e734      c6401600       mov byte [rax + 0x16], 0
|           0x56315b93e738      c78518ffffff.  mov dword [local_e8h], 0x631caf

|           0x56315b93e7b0      48894810       mov qword [rax + 0x10], rcx
|           0x56315b93e7b4      c6401800       mov byte [rax + 0x18], 0
|           0x56315b93e7b8      c745e8d41d63.  mov dword [local_18h], 0x631dd4
```
So let's analyse one of them and so we can figure the whole thing out. Reading from top to down we see:
```
|           0x56315b93e6cb      48ba43205072.  movabs rdx, 0x6172676f72502043
|           0x56315b93e6d5      488910         mov qword [rax], rdx
|           0x56315b93e6d8      c740086d6d69.  mov dword [rax + 8], 0x6e696d6d ; [0x6e696d6d:4]=-1
|           0x56315b93e6df      66c7400c6700   mov word [rax + 0xc], 0x67 ; 'g' ; [0x67:2]=0xffff ; 103
|           0x56315b93e6e5      488d8550feff.  lea rax, qword [local_1b0h]
```
As you can see, some big hex chunks are being moved to memory starting at local_1b0h moveabs is used as we intend to move larger chunks. And if we put everything together: 432050726f6772616d6d696e67 = C Programming in ASCII. (remember the endianess). Known that, you can figure out the rest of the code. It is important to remark that even though we use strcpy, the program does it itself, instead of calling whatever function.

Also note that we can "link" a struct to multiple data addresses and thus monitor multiple memory segments while the program goes on.


Aaand thats all for this post, during the following posts we'll be go deeper on these topics.
