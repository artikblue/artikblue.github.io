Hi, my name is Pavlo Osadchyi. I'm a Software Engineer with 8 years of experience in full-stack software development, software architecture, team leadership and agile methodologies. 

I like the idea outlined in the book [Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/), that *rather than construction, software is more like gardening - it is more organic than concrete*. And in this sense, we, as Software Engineers, are also Software *Gardeners*. During my career, I've been learning how to write correct programs in constantly changing environments, *nurture* and *take care* of them so that they *grow* in something that makes end users (as well as maintainers) happy.

I had a chance to work on many projects in teams of different sizes. I've got a solid grasp of such things like testing, debugging, how to write correct and maintainable code. I'm extremely product-driven.
I always try to pick the best tool for the job, therefore I was able to work with numerous front-end and back-end web technologies such as: React, Ember.js, Ruby On Rails, Java Spring MVC, Elixir, Python Flask, Terraform, Kubernetes.
